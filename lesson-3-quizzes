/*
 * Programming Quiz: Murder Mystery (3-4)
 *
 * For this quiz, you're going to help solve a fictitious murder mystery that happened here at Udacity!
 * A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the partygoers is secretly, and unknowingly,
 * playing a murderer, and the other attendees must determine who among them is the criminal. It's a classic case of whodunnit.
 * Since this might be your first time playing a murder mystery, we've simplified things quite a bit to make it easier.
 * 
 * Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:
 * four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, dining room,
 * four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife
 * four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
 *
 * We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...
 * the poison belongs to the ballroom
 * the trophy belongs to the gallery
 * the pool stick belongs to the billiards room
 * the knife belongs to the dining room.
 *
 * And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.
 * Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
 * Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
 * Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
 * Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
 *
 * To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:
 * sets the value of weapon based on the room and
 * sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
 *
 * Afterwards, print the following to the console if the mystery was solved:
 * __________ did it in the __________ with the __________!
 *Fill in the blanks with the name of the suspect, the room, and the weapon.

// change the value of `room` and `suspect` to test code

    weapon = "knife";
    if (suspect === "Mr. Parkes")
    {
        solved = true;

    weapon = "pool stick";
